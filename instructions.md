What Story will you Tell?
A data scientist needs to be able to present her insights in a manner that will be accessible to a diverse audience.

What We’re Looking For
See official project rubric here.

For this project, you are required to build an interactive Shiny application that can create visual representations of data insights and trends. Make sure there is a balance of interactivity and simplicity that allows an outside user to both understand your points and also uncover their own insights without distractions of unnecessary details. Choose a dataset that can demonstrate a story or problem. If you have trouble finding one, feel free to consult a TA for assistance.

Successful projects will encompass a plethora of skills including, but not limited to:

Submission in respect to the deadline.
Background knowledge of dataset(s).
Communication of motivation: why do we care?
Research questions/answers of interest
Time management (not going over the allotted time).
Ability to answer audience questions.
Explanation of future work: what would you do if given more time, data, etc.?
Ability of an arbitrary audience to glean insights in your absence.
Use of R and ggplot2, and Shiny.
